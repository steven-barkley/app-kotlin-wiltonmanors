#### Meeting notes w/David Larsen

Idea for push notifications was brought up at director's meeting. The Library is within the Leisure services department. The agreed project time is sixty days only. The proposed problem is : People don't have an easy way to get notifications from the city of Wilton Manors. David Larsen proposes that a mobile app be developed that sends push notifications to user's mobile device. 

Other City Apps : SaferWatch , LauderServ, Lauderdale By the Sea

Other City Publications : Town Crier

#### Notes from Kotlin : Use ${} to surround variables and calculations in the text of print statements. For example: ${age} where age is a variable.
Create a variable using the val keyword and a name. Once set, this value cannot be changed. Assign a value to a variable using the equal sign. Examples of values are text and numbers.
A String is text surrounded by quotes, such as "Hello".
An Int is a whole positive or negative number, such as 0, 23, or -1024.
You can pass one or more arguments into a function for the function to use, for example: fun printCakeBottom(age:Int, layers:Int) {}
Use a repeat() {} statement to repeat a set of instructions several times. For example: repeat (23) { print("%") } or repeat (layers) { print("@@@@@@@@@@") }
A loop is an instruction to repeat instructions multiple times. A repeat() statement is an example of a loop.
You can nest loops, that is, put loops within loops. For example, you can create a repeat() statement within a repeat() statement to print a symbol a number of times for a number of rows, like you did for the cake layers.
Summary of using function arguments: To use arguments with a function, you need to do three things:

Add the argument and type to the function definition: printBorder(border: String)
Use the argument inside the function: println(border)
Supply the argument when you call the function: printBorder(border)
